# Best Practices:

"You will learn about four best practices to make sure that your code can serve a dual purpose:"

  - Put most code into a function or class.
  - Use __name__ to control execution of your code.
  - Create a function called main() to contain the code you want to run.
  - Call other functions from main().

We already have it set up this way but I finally just read that [Real Python link](https://realpython.com/python-main-function/) and I get it now. Legit good article
