# Action Items:

- does VS code highlight all variables or just the same name?

- is there only one local scope at a time?

- what is // operator

- is if statement its own code block

- review 4 pillars of OOP

# Left Off:

- updating tic tac toe board Blake and Steven style

- chapter 5 practice projects, fantasy game inventory, and list to dict function underneath


# tic-tac-toe To Do:

1. put good, uniform pep8 comments in all functions

2. figure out turn counter approach, "if turn is >= 5, then run check-winner function"
    - or potentially something better
    - consider getting away from for loop (while?)
        - (while there is no winner, keep going)

3. make it to where user can type "I" anytime (for instructions)

4. make separate function for error messages/validation

5. create a "check-winner" function

6. exception handling
    - input: (can enter numbers only (1-9) or "i")
    - game board positions (so they can't overwrite, provide invalid error message)
